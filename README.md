# Text-Classification-Keras
Tried my hand at Text Classification on the 20_newsgroup and the imdb dataset.

On the 20_newsgroup dataset, used GloVE embedding along with 1D Convolutional Neural Network.

On the Imdb dataset, used simple Bidirectional LSTM Neural Network.

To replicate the execution it would be great if the user has a tensorflow gpu environment setup, which can be done in PyCharm by setting a virtual anaconda environment with tensorflow gpu
